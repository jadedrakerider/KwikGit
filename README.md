# KwikGit

A few shell scripts to make updating single-developer projects easy. To add to your project, copy and past this into the terminal in your project folder into a folder named "sh" for "shell":

```
git submodule add https://github.com/jadedrakerider/KwikGit.git sh
```

## NPM Projects

Easily start NPM projects with this (assuming you put the module in ./sh):

```
bash sh/startNPM.sh
```
